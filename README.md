# Using Codespaces
The future of development is here. Codespaces allows you to code in a virtual machine as long as you have Internet connection.

The codespaces environment is available free for _small_ projects, but only one at a time. This one is hosted and paid for by the "Team" you are in for class. That allows you to have multiple codespaces - one for each repository!

There are certain limitations but it is improving all the time.

Play around in here, try to run the node-script.js file, preview the index.html file, and maybe commit your changes.
